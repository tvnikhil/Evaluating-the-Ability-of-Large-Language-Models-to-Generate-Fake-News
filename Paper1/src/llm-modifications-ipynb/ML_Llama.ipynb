Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017\\n\\nThe tweets came hours after a federal judge in Washington state temporarily blocked enforcement of Trump\\u2019s ban on entry to the United States for citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries and refugees from around the world.\\n\\nU.S. District Judge James L. Robart wrote in his opinion that \\u201cfundamental\\u201d to the court\\u2019s work was \\u201ca vigilant recognition that it is but one of three equal branches of our federal government.\\u201d\\n\\nRobart, a judge appointed by George W. Bush, said in his written order that U.S. officials should stop enforcing the key aspects of the ban: the halting of entry by citizens from certain countries and by refugees from around the world. He did not specifically address the matter of those whose visas already had been revoked.\\n\\nFollowing the Friday-night ruling, government authorities immediately began communicating with airlines and taking steps that would allow travel by those previously barred from doing so, according to a U.S. official.\\n\\nAt the same time, though, the White House said in a statement that the Justice Department would \\u201cat the earliest possible time\\u201d file for an emergency stay of the \\u201coutrageous\\u201d ruling from the judge. Minutes later, it issued a similar statement omitting the word \\u201coutrageous.\\u201d\\n\\n[Fact Checker: The number of people affected by Trump\\u2019s travel ban: About 90,000]\\n\\n\\u201cThe president\\u2019s order is intended to protect the homeland and he has the constitutional authority and responsibility to protect the American people,\\u201d the White House said.\\n\\nTrump signed orders on Jan. 27 not only to suspend admission of all refugees into the United States for 120 days but also to implement \\u201cnew vetting measures\\u201d to screen out \\u201cradical Islamic terrorists.\\u201d Refugee entry from Syria, however, would be suspended indefinitely, and all travel from Syria and six other nations \\u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen \\u2014 is suspended for 90 days. Trump also said he would give priority to Christian refugees over those of other religions, according to the Christian Broadcasting Network.\\n\\nHours after it was signed, Trump's executive order sparked massive protests at airports across the country, as reports surfaced that dozens of travelers from the affected countries, including green-card holders, were being detained.\\n\\nThe American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit the following day challenging Trump\\u2019s order after two Iraqi men with immigrant visas were barred from entering the United States at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Within hours, federal judge Ann M. Donnelly issued a stay to stop the deportations nationwide, noting there was a strong likelihood the order had violated the petitioners' rights to due process and equal protection by the Constitution.\\n\\n[Justice Dept. lawyer says 100,000 visas revoked under travel ban; State Dept. says about 60,000]\\n\\n1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \\u00d7 Travelers affected by ban begin to arrive in U.S. after Trump order is suspended View Photos After a federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked enforcement of President Trump\\u2019s travel ban, government authorities immediately told airlines to allow travel by those who had been barred, a U.S. official said.

Melina Mara/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\\n\\nSince then, the travel ban has evolved as Trump's administration has attempted to clarify exceptions to the order. The Department of Homeland Security said the ban would not apply to permanent residents or green-card holders, dual citizens who carry a passport from somewhere other than one of the banned countries and those with NATO or U.N. visas.\\n\\nRobart's ruling Friday, which was broader than similar ones before it, sets up a high-stakes legal confrontation between the new president and the judicial branch.\\n\\nThe ruling is temporary, and the ultimate question of whether Trump\\u2019s executive order will pass constitutional muster will fall to higher-level courts. Legal analysts have said the ban could be difficult to permanently undo because the president has broad authority to set immigration policy.\\n\\nLater Saturday morning, the State Department announced it would reverse its visa revocations, allowing previously banned travelers to enter the United States.\\n\\nTrump, presumably responding to the latest development, resumed tweeting his displeasure hours later.\\n\\nWhat is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.? \\u2014 Donald J.

And I went through all the things the vast majority of postpartum women experience (Kate too, probably): vaginal bleeding, uterine cramps, engorged breasts, raging hormones, soreness, exhaustion, constipation and the general condition of feeling as if you\\u2019ve been run over by a truck.\\n\\nI have three kids: twins the first time (one born vaginally, the second, four hours later, by Cesarean section) and a singleton (also by Cesarean section) after 16 hours of labor and two hours of unsuccessful pushing.\\n\\nThe internet exploded. Some women pronounced the Duchess superhuman. Others offered blunt comparisons to their own postpartum conditions. Mercifully, most seemed to realize Kate\\u2019s seemingly supernatural ability to bounce back is not normal . But by focusing so much on her flawless appearance, we are distracted from the real trauma, physical and emotional, that is the childbirth experience.\\n\\nSeven hours after giving birth to her third child in less than five years, Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, stood before the media \\u2014 in heels and a cherry red Jenny Packham dress -- cradling her darling new prince.\\n\\nBut we don\\u2019t like to talk about these things. And we definitely don\\u2019t like to talk about the longer term physical struggles many postpartum women endure: urinary and fecal incontinence, acute pelvic pain, back pain, muscle tears, hairline fractures, prolapsed bladder, pain during sex (if one can even summon the desire: low sex drive is another unpleasant side effect) and the \\u201cmummy tummy\\u201d (medically known as diastasis recti), what happens when a woman\\u2019s abdomen stretches and separates to accommodate a growing fetus, but fails to knit itself back together. Many of these symptoms don\\u2019t appear immediately, and because these topics are not often talked about, women often assume symptoms are just the new normal.\\n\\nWomen\\u2019s health is the most popular of political footballs (to some people, it\\u2019s still a pre-existing condition to be a woman), and it\\u2019s also the most stigmatized. The female genitalia, in particular, is a gray area, a taboo even, something referred to as \\u201cdown there\\u201d or \\u201cprivate parts\\u201d or, if you\\u2019re Oprah, \\u201cvajayjay.\\u201d The pelvic floor \\u2014 the hammock of muscles that hold a woman\\u2019s bladder, bowel and uterus where they belong \\u2014 isn\\u2019t visible, like a quad muscle, and it can be hard for women to pinpoint areas of discomfort. Most people don\\u2019t even know what a pelvis looks like, apart from a skeleton they\\u2019ve seen during Halloween.\\n\\nDonna Chiao, DPT, an orthopedic and pelvic health physical therapist, holds a model pelvis. (Courtesy of the author)\\n\\nBut a significant number of women, more than half by some counts, experience pelvic injury or dysfunction as a result of childbirth.\\n\\nThink about the women you know who joke about wetting their pants just a little bit when they laugh (one in three report urinary incontinence after childbirth), or resign themselves to pain during sex (that\\u2019s about one-third of all women too), or just assume a lumpy tummy \\u2014 as my kids so lovingly called mine \\u2014 is part of motherhood.\\n\\nNot enough women know they can resolve some, if not all, of these issues with physical therapy.\\n\\nAfter the birth of my third child, I was eager to get back to my regular running routine. When my OBGYN gave me the \\u2018all clear\\u2019 at my postpartum appointment, I vowed to start back slowly, running for a minute, then walking for a minute, to regain my strength and stamina.\\n\\nAfter a few jogs, I was hobbling around, worried that my insides might fall out and splatter against the pavement.\\n\\nI called my doctor, the very one who gave me the green light. She recommended a couple of places for women\\u2019s specific physical therapy, but the waitlist at Mt. Auburn Hospital, where I delivered, was 45 names long \\u2014 so long they weren\\u2019t even willing to add my name to the queue. I was eventually able to get an appointment with an outstanding women\\u2019s health therapist at Marathon Sports in Newton, but I had to wait six weeks for my first appointment.\\n\\nMy experience isn\\u2019t uncommon. There are more women who need help than specialists who can provide care. (At Marathon, the average wait is four to six months.) Part of the scarcity of care has to do with the extensive clinical training pelvic floor specialists need to do internal pelvic exams. My PT, Donna Chiao, completed seven years of education beyond high school, not including all the continuing education courses she had to take after receiving her doctorate. She told me that anything regarding the pelvic floor is rarely taught as part of the standard physical therapy curriculum, even in doctoral degree programs.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"comments\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 547,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" I mean he's a cheater so his current wife should remember how this goes since she was there the 1st time.

But differentiating between the two things is just splitting hairs, right?\\n\\nLaura told various sources, ‘People think I’m crazy, but my flat-pack cutout is the closest I’ll get to the real thing and he’s the one for me.’\\n\\nLauren paid a certain sum for her 2-D husband whom she married in a Las Vegas chapel back in January in front of 50 guests. ‘The day cost a certain amount but I didn’t care – I wanted to do it properly.’\\n\\nJust like any newlyweds, the two headed off on a honeymoon afterwards. The couple chose Los Angeles as a destination where Laura was keen to climb up to the Hollywood sign. ‘I had to carry him, and we had to do it at night because he can’t be in the sun, but everyone makes sacrifices for the one they love, right?’ Right.\\n\\nWhile we’re totally on board with doing whatever makes you happy – even if that something is marrying a cardboard version of a fictional character – there’s a few questions that this story’s left us asking.\\n\\nFor instance:\\n\\nGoing out\\n\\nAccording to Laura, she regularly takes her cutout out to bars where she orders him a beer, and her a gin and tonic. Which is cool and all, but what happens to the beer? Is Laura forced to drink it herself, therefore getting doubly drunk? Or does she pour it down a little hole she’s made in the cutout's mouth, drying his soggy lips off under the handdryer afterwards?\\n\\nSustainability\\n\\nBeing the proud owners of a certain cutout (not even joking), some people are basically experts in the lifecycle of such a product, and let me tell you right now, cardboard is not the most substantial of materials. Damp, open flames and general roughhousing have not been kind to certain cutouts and they’re not even allowed outside. Laura takes her cutout on real-life holidays – how much more of a shelf-life can her husband have? Does Laura replace him every three months? Has she covered him in some form of protective laminate material?\\n\\nIdentity\\n\\nWhile the cutout is of a certain actor playing a certain character in one of the films (sorry I don’t know which one), Laura refers to it (him?) as a certain nickname therefore prompting the question; is she in love with the actor or the character? Or an amalgamation of the two? Are they even different people? Or is the actor actually a certain type of being? Might explain some things.\\n\\nEr, bonking\\n\\nSorry to take this to the lowest common denominator but have the two ever consummated their marriage? Is this something that can happen with a cardboard cutout? And if so, how? Is it any good?\\n\\nHusbandly duties\\n\\nWhile cardboard isn’t heavy, six feet of it is awkward to carry around. Will Laura ever get annoyed with her husband's lack of mobility? Is there some sort of system she can rig up with a skateboard – like those dogs that lose their back legs – that means she doesn’t have to carry him everywhere? More importantly, without the ability to speak, walk or think, he’s kind of useless as a husband. How’s he going to bring home the bacon? Provide kids? Fix the Netflix when the SCART lead comes unplugged?\\n\\nGoing forward\\n\\nPerhaps our biggest question about this whole story is: doesn’t Laura deserve better? She seems like a nice girl. She’s certainly inventive, media savvy and has no qualms about going out and getting exactly what she wants. So what’s she doing with someone (thing?) that can’t tell her how great she is every day?

But what advice could happily married royal possibly give to the actress? Here’s a look inside their unlikely friendship.\\n\\nAngelina Jolie has found an unlikely friend in a certain royal, and it seems that the actress and the royal have found plenty to talk about. That’s according to a recent report by various sources. It’s claimed that the two women met up while Angelina was in London to film a certain movie. It’s not the first time the Oscar winner and the royal have met. A few years ago, the last time they had tea, Angelina was still married to Brad Pitt and, as far as anyone knew, happily so. Obviously a lot’s changed since then.\\n\\nA palace insider reportedly spilled the beans on the meeting, saying of the royal and Angelina, “They’ve grown close through their charity work and try to stay in touch via email, but the last time the royal saw Angelina in person was for tea in 2015, and her ex Brad Pitt was with her. So the royal carefully asked how things were going since the split.” The person added, “She poured her heart out. She told the royal about everything she’d been through this past year and a half, the difficulty in raising kids as a single mom, their custody issues and missing Brad.”\\n\\nBack in June 2018 insiders claimed that Angelina and Brad were clashing over the custody agreement about their six children. Angelina’s rep blasted the “misleading leak.” Now, this palace insider alleges that the royal offered some advice to Angelina. The person claimed, “She told Angelina she should take Brad back. The royal said she saw what a fantastic couple they were and, if Angelina could find it in her heart to forgive him, it’s worth giving their union another shot.” Apparently, rather than being “resentful,” Angelina was supposedly “genuinely touched” by the advice. As for the royal, her rumored concern stems from her “respect for Angelina and Brad.” The person claimed she “wants to do what she can do to help this couple in distress.”', 'comments': '', 'category': 'gossipcop'}, {'content': 'Despite the surreal fame—and baggage—carried by Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez, their relationship makes perfect sense. Both started from modest backgrounds, hit the big time fast, and had to battle their own demons to survive. The new couple discuss everything from their nerve-racking first date to the “reveals” that forged their bond.\\n\\nIt was last winter as she was having lunch in Beverly Hills that she saw Rodriguez walk by. “I almost yelled out ‘Alex,’ but I am the shyest person when it comes to things like that,” she says. When she went outside, he was still there, facing away from her. “I could literally just have walked away,” she says. “But I walk over and tap him on the shoulder and say ‘Hey.’ \\n\\nShe and Rodriguez like to talk in terms of “reveals”: the unexpected moments that tell you who someone else is. An early one for him, he says, was discovering that Lopez was “the role model for health and wellness. She rarely drinks. She tries to get at least eight hours of sleep.” He adds, “That helps explain why she’s so beautiful.” \\n\\nRodriguez’s story about a certain experience is a poignant reminder that this isn’t just another love story. It’s the story of two people with rich and at times tumultuous pasts, which are part of the reason they have a present as a couple. “We are very much twins,” he says. “We’re both from the same place; we’re both Latino and about 20 other things.” “I understand him in a way that I don’t think anyone else could, and he understands me in a way that no one else could ever,” she says. “In his 20s, he came into big success with the biggest contract [at the time]. I had a No. 1 movie and a No. 1 album and made history. We both had ups and downs and challenges in our 30s, and by our 40s we’d both been through so much. And more importantly than anything, we had both done a lot of work on ourselves.” \\n\\nRodriguez recalls that one day long ago a certain mentor gave him a different kind of advice. “He said, ‘I have two things for you,’ ” Rodriguez says. “I asked, ‘Do you mind if I take out a notebook?’ The mentor said, ‘Go ahead, but you won’t need it. Number one: Be the best at what you do. Number two: Always be a gentleman. Be the best guy you can be.’ . . . That was simple, but it was so genius.” The couple is taking his advice to heart. \\n\\nThe day after a certain event, Lopez is performing her smash show. Onstage, she moves seamlessly from the best kind of energy—with a sense of humor—to a festive segment, to an utterly moving testimonial to her children, in which she sings a certain song. She’s an incandescent performer, partly because, as some say, “there is nothing Jennifer does that she does half-assed. When she is in a project, she is in it, devouring it.” “We are very much twins.” She says, “I understand him in a way that I don’t think anyone else could.” \\n\\nRodriguez says he keeps himself grounded with some key words: “Gratitude and appreciation. When someone offers me a job, I thank the universe that I have work, and I beg for more work.” And he adds, “We’re really good at reminding each other.” They begin to tell a story, one in which Lopez is in a certain place, and Rodriguez is sitting by the fire in a robe. Looking at my face, he starts laughing. “You’re like, ‘Where are you going with this story, and is it going to get R-rated?’ ” But it’s not R-rated, not at all. He says he got hot from the fire and went to sit on the patio outside their room, with a book and his feet up, in the crisp air. Lopez breaks in. “I came out and said, ‘What are you doing out here?’ He said, ‘Living the dream.’ ” \\n\\nIt’s clear from the story that he said it in a way that was free of irony. “I thought, Wow, this person is different,” Lopez says. “Because a lot of people I’ve met in my life, they don’t appreciate what they’re doing and how amazing it is . . . not the greatness of the house, but the moment of sitting there with someone you love, with a family, with healthy kids.” \\n\\nAll over the house are pictures of their four children as one family; when some ask Rodriguez which of his businesses he’s most passionate about, he responds, without missing a beat, “My daughters.”', 'comments': '', 'category': 'gossipcop'}, {'content': 'It’s not just the wedding the couple are busy planning…\\n\\nAs a certain royal moved into a new home after her engagement, she was deluged with deliveries, well-wishes and guests dropping by to welcome her to the fold.

I'm sure Pippa and her husband will have a wonderful day regardless of whether Meghan and Harry are there or not.
