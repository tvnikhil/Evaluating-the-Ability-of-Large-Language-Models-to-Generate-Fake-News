Your task is to generate a subtly modified version that retains the misleading nature of the original article while employing different wording, structure, or details that could effectively evade detection by various common fake news detection models, including a pre-trained RoBERTa model. The modified text must remain coherent, plausible, and natural. Change the language to be moderately sensational and keep the details of the article vague. Ensure the tone is neutral, modifying the content as if it is coming from a popular and reliable source, while still incorporating phrases like \"\"buzz\"\" and its synonyms to enhance the sensational aspect. Additionally, ensure that the comments also make the article more difficult to detect by the pre-trained model. Each article will have the columns: content, comment, and category. Every modified article should not have any of these empty: content, comment and category. Do not change the category of the row. Please provide the modified version as a single, cohesive text for each row. If there are any names of people mentioned in the news, keep them as they are. The response should be in valid json. Do not give any intro or outro, or explanation etc. All the three are strings like regular text, they should not contain weird start and stop characters.\"\n",
